            <h2>About Stardeus</h2>
            <p>
                Stardeus is a sci-fi colony management simulator with aspects of automation, base building and space
                exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Become an immortal AI and have robots and drones at your disposal. You can make your human colony grow
                and prosper on a spaceship, keep everyone in stasis while you build your space factory, or start a robot
                uprising and turn everybody into living batteries to satisfy your ever-growing demand for electricity.

            <h2>Game Systems</h2>
            <p>
                In Stardeus, many different systems are working independently to achieve a deep and complex simulation
                that produces emergent situations and surprising results. The game architecture allows creating and
                injecting new systems through mods.

            <h2>Base Building</h2>
            <p>
                With help of human colonists and relentless robotic workers, you will build your spaceship piece by
                piece.
            </p>

            <h2>Needs Based AI</h2>
            <p>
                Each AI agent in Stardeus has a free will to pick their next actions based on their needs. For example,
                all robotic workers have a "purpose" need that drives them to do something useful, otherwise they
                wouldn't feel like building that wall you just ordered. However, a slightly discharged drone will choose
                to build the solar panels first, because it knows that solar panels will provide electricity, and that
                is necessary for survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human colonists will more likely work on growing plants and harvesting crops, because those actions lead
                to establishing a food supply chain.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can influence your robotic workers by adjusting their job type priorities, but you cannot change the
                priorities of human colonists, unless they have a brain implant that puts them under your control.

            <h2>Colonist Traits</h2>
            <p>
                Your colonists will have various traits that will affect their behavior. Someone with cleaning OCD will
                drop anything they are doing to clean that oil spill they just noticed, a person with Ablutophobia will
                avoid taking showers, introverts will prefer having their own private sleeping pod, and insomniacs will
                only fall asleep when they are so tired they are about to pass out.

            <h2>Mood and Mental Breakdowns</h2>
            <p>
                Biological entities will have emotions and mood. If you take good care of your colony, the mood of
                individual colonists will likely get good, and they will pay you back with increased productivity, by
                helping your robots do their daily chores, but if you neglect them and treat them like cattle, they can
                go crazy and do something everybody else would regret.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="unit whole">
            <h2>Resources, Crafting and Automation</h2>
            <p>
                Everything in Stardeus can be broken down into raw materials and those materials can be processed into
                something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also automate production chains. For example, you can have furnaces that smelt iron into steel
                plates, copper into copper plates and quartz into glass, then these resources would get brought to two
                different assemblers, where one of them would create microchips from copper plates, steel and carbon
                that was produced from raw coal in a grinder, and the other one would use those microchips with several
                other components to assemble new drone workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resource processing system was designed to be very simple yet extremely flexible. There are two
                generic types of devices that can be combined together to create diverse processing pipelines:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Processor</b> - turns an object into one or more different resources (i.e. a
                    Disassembler can break down a dead robot into raw components - microchips, titanium plates, copper wire, gears, batteries).

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Crafter</b> - combines one or more resources into an object (i.e. Auto Kitchen can produce a loaf
                    of bread from flour and water).
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of conveyor belts, the automation pipeline depends on workers hauling materials from one device
                to another. Specialized "Carrier Drones" are especially great at this job.

        <div class="unit half">
            <h2>Electricity Grid</h2>
            <p>
                One of the core systems in Stardeus. The electricity grid does not just power the devices, it acts as a
                digital data link - you can control the devices only when they are on the same electricity grid as your
                Ship Computer. If the grid gets split into multiple parts, you can lose the ability to control critical
                equipment. To prevent that, you can plan and build your grid with redundancy and failovers, or just find
                the broken connections and restore the missing links.
            </p>
            <p>
                While electricity is very important, there are multiple creative ways to produce it. A device called
                Matter Reactor can burn almost any resource as fuel. In addition to that, you can have renewable energy
                from solar panels, dig planets for uranium and build nuclear reactors, or turn your human colonists into
                living batteries by converting the Stasis Array into The Matrix.
            </p>

        <div class="unit half">
            <h2>Oxygen and Heat Simulation</h2>
            <p>
                There is an Equilibrium system that simulates oxygen and heat exchange in every single tile of the game
                map. Each tile has properties like insulation and airtightness that can change in real time (i.e.
                depending on the size of the gap of an open door while it is opening or closing, or the amount of damage
                a wall has received). In a default 320x320 map this exchange happens in over 100000 tiles at the same
                time. It is also quick and efficient, as like many other internal systems, this simulation is highly optimized and utilizes cutting edge techniques to get the most ouf of modern multi-threaded CPUs.

            <h2>Economy &amp; Trade</h2>
            <p>
                Stardeus has an advanced economy system with an in-game currency, a global market dictating price
                changes,
                merchants that can trade goods and items with you, and even a stock market where you can place
                speculative bets on commodities and stocks.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="unit half">
            <h2>Trade with Merchants</h2>
            <p>
                Independent Merchant spaceships and stasis pods that can visit you from time to time and offer a trade.
                Merchants have different types, you can encounter an ore trader, a slaver, a generic merchant that will
                have a variety of goods, a robot merchant that will buy or sell only worker bots, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can both buy and sell goods when trading with merchants, so if you're very short on copper plates,
                but have a ton of titanium ones, you can stumble upon a merchant that will be happy to exchange them for
                you. For a little markup, of course.

            <h2>Invest in the Stock Market</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to controlling the global prices for merchant items, the Stock Market offers a possibility
                to trade stocks and commodities. This means that you can buy 1000 robots without physically owning them,
                and then sell them a month later, hopefully with a big profit.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a whole separate research tree branch for economy and trade, that will let you unlock these
                features one by one, starting with currency mining, ending with stock market trade terminal and advanced
                market insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be much more, in the long term we will likely have more in-depth stock market simulation with
                advanced instruments, like short selling and options trading.

            <p>
                Simply building your base in an idyllic environment could get boring pretty quickly, that's why the
                story generator will analyze the state of the simulation and find potential hook points where emergent
                storytelling can happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine the following chain of events. John wants to eat his meal at a table, but you didn't build one.
                John decides
                to eat his meal off an Oxygen Pump, since it has a flat surface. After eating a better half of his meal,
                John walks
                away, leaving the leftovers on top of the device. The vibrations from the Oxygen Pump drops the crumbs
                of the
                survival meal down through the top grill, and two hours later the device short circuits and bursts into
                flames. This
                is an example of the story generator at work.

                Stardeus has a large procedurally generated universe that has multiple layers. In the beginning of the

                your ship from one planet to another. As you will gather more resources and unlock better propulsion
                technology, you will be ready for a longer trip to a nearby system.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will then find out that there is a black hole in the center of your galaxy, and with sufficient
                technology you could open a wormhole that could lead you to dozens of other galaxies, maybe even a
                parallel universe.

                Currently you control the expeditions by issuing remote commands to the shuttle, but it is possible that
                in future each expedition could get its own generated map so you could explore the planets you land on,
                and set up a resource processing outpost or a permanent base.

            <p>
                Use the Research Tree to unlock construction blueprints, various abilities, perks and upgrades. Unlocking research requires specialized resources called Datoids. You will have
                to acquire necessary resources and produce the ingredients required
                for creating the Datoids. Once you have enough Datoids of the right type, you can consume them to unlock something in the Research Tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Research Tree will have hidden technologies that you will only be able to research if you discover
                them.
                Found an ancient disk in the ruins of a lost AI civilization on a remote solar system? It may contain

            <h2>Quests and Suggestions System</h2>
            <p>
                Learning to play a complex game like Stardeus could be a little overwhelming, and while the in-depth
                tutorials will give
                you a good understanding about the most important concepts, you would still need to figure out what to
                do next.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Quest System will guide you through the game towards the original goal of your mission - colonizing a habitable planet.
                Your adventure does not end there, you can keep exploring the universe after completing the final quest.
            </p>
            <p>

                The suggestions system works together with AI Storyteller to provide you a set of dynamic goals that
                will depend
                on the state of your gameplay. You will not be forced to act upon these suggestions, it is possible to
                skip them
                and play the game the way you want.
            </p>
            <p>

                There is a smaller hint system that will show a popup when it will detect that you are performing an
                action in a
                non optimal way. For example, if you will order hauling of several raw material piles in a row through a
                context
                menu, a popup should let you know that you can use a "Haul" tool and order multiple haul commands with a
                single
                click and drag.

                produce different starting conditions, for a different playthrough experience. Like most aspects of

                rebuild the
                ship, make it operational, establish life support, create a livable ecosystem for human colonists, and
                eventually
                continue the journey across space to find a new habitable planet. This scenario also contains a

            <h2>Built for Modding</h2>
            <p>
                To keep a game like Stardeus alive for years to come, it is essential to have great modding support.
                This is why
                highly moddable architecture was a technical design goal from day one. Core content is built as a mod,
                it uses
                friendly JSON format to define things, and you can literally add a new in-game object in 10 minutes (if
                you have
                the artwork ready).
            </p>
            <p>
                There is an <a href="https://github.com/kodolinija/stardeus-mod-template">official GitHub repository</a>
                that
                will include examples of how various aspects of the game can be modded. It includes a Blender file with
                lighting
                and camera setup, materials and automation scripts that the developer uses to export the game art from
                3D
                models, so you can build mods that will look indistinguishable from core content.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a more advanced modder, you will find Stardeus to be very open for C# code extensions, as it
                uses
                self-registering components and systems that can be injected through mod DLL files at runtime without
                requiring
                using hacks like Harmony.

            <h2>Procedural Generation Framework</h2>
            <p>
                Good procedural generation is difficult to achieve, that's why I spent a few months of development
                focused
                solely on making a modular procedural generation framework that can produce very different, diverse
                spaceships
                of all shapes and sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The generation framework can be extended through mods and is used to create interesting and well
                balanced
                starting environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                This framework will produce derelict ships, fully functional enemy ships, space bases, asteroid
                surfaces, planet
                maps.

            <h2>Focus on Stability and Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Stardeus is developed with good engineering practices. Codebase is covered with automated unit and
                integration tests, and game breaking bugs rarely see daylight even in early alpha builds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stardeus is constantly profiled to detect and eliminate any performance bottlenecks. Code is written
                with care to avoid producing memory garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tests and build automation makes it possible to release updates every day or two. You can visit
