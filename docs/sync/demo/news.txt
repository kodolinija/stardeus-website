Greetings, Space Traveler!

Stardeus has come a long way in the year since its Early Access launch. This update is the largest to date, featuring:

- A brand new research system
- New tutorials
- New content
- Numerous UI enhancements
- Hundreds of balance adjustments
- Reworked systems and mechanics

Old save files are compatible, but we recommend taking the new tutorials and starting a fresh game.
