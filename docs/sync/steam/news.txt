Greetings, Space Traveler,

It's that time of year when the void between stars gets just a little spookier! Our latest update brings you the most essential research in intergalactic history: Halloween Decorations. Outfit your colony with jack-o'-lanterns, decorative skulls, ghostly statues, and enough tombstones to spook even the bravest space explorer. Oh, and don't forget the decorative coffins - because nothing says "home" like a stylish final resting place.

For our botanically inclined captains, we've added pumpkins for your planters and a new culinary delight: Pumpkin Soup! Serve it to your crew to keep their bones warm while they wander through your ghostly halls...
