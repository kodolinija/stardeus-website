Greetings, Space Traveler!

We're happy to announce the first major Stardeus update since launch to Early Access. Although it's centered around Derelict Ships, there's much more to it.

Existing saves will work, but may feel off-balance. So if you haven't played for a while or got to the late game, it's a great time to start a brand new Wrecked scenario and experience the refreshed and rebalanced version of the gameplay.
