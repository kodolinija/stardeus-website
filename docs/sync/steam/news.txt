Greetings, Space Traveler!

The second major update is now in your hands! There are tons of new features, mechanics and balance changes. The old saves will work, but it is recommended to start a brand new run of the Wrecked scenario.

<b>Warning</b>! The difficulty has increased, the Wrecked scenario will feel more resource constrained and you will have to find creative ways to survive and expand in a controlled way.

If you want a more relaxed ship building experience, visit the Modifiers to change the Difficulty or give yourself more resources when starting a new game.
