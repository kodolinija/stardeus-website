Greetings, Space Traveler!

The electricity system was recently rewritten from the ground up. Large ships with thousands of electric devices will now be able to simulate the electricity flow much faster! Unfortunately, <color=#FF4040FF>most mods that interacted with the electricity system are no longer compatible with v0.9</color>.

If you choose to load a save file that relied on an obsolete mod, you may expect the following:
- New electric devices added by the mod will disappear
- Electricity grid connections added by mod that extends the connector range / capacity will be removed, so you may have to rewire your ship.

There is also a way to continue playing the older v0.8 - read the full announcement to find out how.
